          <h3>The Little Ones</h3>
          <br />
          <h4>Litter</h4>
          <br />
          <p>
            Baby wolves are called pups. Usually 4 to 6 pups are born together,
            this is called a litter, and the pups in a litter are called
            littermates. Pups are born inside a den, a den is sometimes a small
            cave or a hole dug out of the ground. The den must be big enough for
            the mother and her pups.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4>Birth</h4>
          <br />
          <p>
            Pups grow inside their mother for about 63 days before being born.
            At birth they weigh only 1 pound and their eyes are closed, pups
            grow quickly. About 12 to 15 days after they are born they open
            their eyes, by 2 weeks of age the pups can walk, and about a week
            after that they may come out of the den for the first time.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4>Care</h4>
          <br />
          <p>
            All the wolves in a pack help take care of the pups. When the pups
            are very small, other pack members bring food to the mother so she
            doesn't have to leave the den. when the pups are a little bigger,
            pack members take turns bringing them food, playing with them and
            even babysitting.

          <h3>About The Gray Wolf</h3>
          <br />
          <h4>Introduction</h4>
          <br />
          <p>
            Wolves are legendary because of their spine-tingling howl, which
            they use to communicate. A lone wolf howls to attract the attention
            of his pack, while communal howls may send territorial messages from
            one pack to another.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4>Behavior</h4>
          <br />
          <p>
            Wolves live and hunt in packs of around six to ten animals. They are
            known to roam large distances, perhaps 12 miles in a single day.
            These social animals cooperate on their preferred prey—large animals
            such as deer, elk, and moose. When they are successful, wolves do
            not eat in moderation.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4>Hierarchy</h4>
          <br />
          <p>
            Wolfpacks are established according to a strict hierarchy, with a
            dominant male at the top and his mate not far behind. Usually this
            male and female are the only animals of the pack to breed. All of a
            pack's adults help to care for young pups by bringing them food and
            watching them while others hunt.

          <h4>Tamed</h4>
          <br />
          <p>
            It’s believed that wolves were first tamed in East Asia about 15,000
            years ago.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4>Widespread</h4>
          <br />
          <p>
            Gray wolves are the planet’s most widespread large land mammals
            after humans and livestock.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4>Pack & Eating</h4>
          <br />
          <p>
            A wolf pack is two or more wolves that have a defined territory.
            Wolves can go for more than a week without eating.
