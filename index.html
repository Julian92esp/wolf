            Wolves are a class of the canine family, and they seem to do very
            well in the right environment. In fact, they are the largest of all
            canines with exception of some dog species. They are meat eaters and
            can range in size considerably depending on where they live. Some of
            them are only about 55 pounds full grown while others can be up to
            200 pounds. They can range in size from 40 to 65 inches in length.
            Such a measurement is from the tip of the nose to the end of the
            tail.<br /><br />

            They have long gotten a bad reputation out there in the wild. They
            are very intelligent animals that live in groups that are known as
            packs. They have thick fur to help them survive in a variety of
            climates. They are found to live in many places throughout the
            Northern Hemisphere. However, the amount of roaming space that they
            have continues to get smaller all the time.
